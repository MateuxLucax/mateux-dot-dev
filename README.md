# [mateux.dev](https://mateux.dev)

This is the source code for my personal website. It is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).
Feel free to use this code as a template for your own website.

## Developing

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

This app uses the static adapter to generate a static version of the site. You can test this with `npm run preview` after running `npm run build`.
